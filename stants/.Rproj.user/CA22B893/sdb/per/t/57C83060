You'll need to download **rstan** below. Additionally, you'll need to download a package we've created for deploying these models called **stants**. This is hosted on Eric's Github repository, and you can install with **devtools**. \n\n```{r load, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(rstan)\nlibrary(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"eric-ward/stants\")\nlibrary(stants)\n```\n\n\n\n\n",
